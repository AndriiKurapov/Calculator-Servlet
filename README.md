Description project: The program is a web application in the form of a calculator with simple functionality. Visualization is implemented through the use of [JSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaServer_Pages) and [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets). To handle user interaction with the calculator, a local server and a [servlet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_servlet) are used for calculation. To make this possible, the software was downloaded and configured, to raise the server on a local machine â€” [Tomcat v9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Tomcat) is an open source servlet container developed by the [Apache Software Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Apache_Software_Foundation). Also, the logging framework - [Apache Log4j](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4j) was used. In addition, a [GET-request](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP#GET) class was implemented in the project, and corresponding tests were written for this class.  
Below is an image of the developed calculator:
